outdoor furniture space,00:00:03.840,00:00:06.350
[Music],00:00:06.360,00:00:14.789
hi sharks my name is jake liu and i'm,00:00:14.799,00:00:16.950
carrie lynn we're the co-founders of,00:00:16.960,00:00:18.950
outer we're seeking 750 thousand dollars,00:00:18.960,00:00:21.590
in exchange for four percent equity,00:00:21.600,00:00:23.109
stake in our company,00:00:23.119,00:00:24.300
[Music],00:00:24.310,00:00:26.070
imagine for a moment it's early in the,00:00:26.080,00:00:27.990
morning,00:00:28.000,00:00:29.029
the house is still quiet,00:00:29.039,00:00:31.109
your coffee just finished brewing,00:00:31.119,00:00:33.510
it's a perfect spring day,00:00:33.520,00:00:35.350
the birds are chirping you look outside,00:00:35.360,00:00:37.350
at your outdoor sofa,00:00:37.360,00:00:39.590
coffee in hand you inhale deeply,00:00:39.600,00:00:41.900
[Music],00:00:41.910,00:00:43.030
oh,00:00:43.040,00:00:44.549
the cushions are wet and now so are my,00:00:44.559,00:00:46.470
pants we call that the soggy bottom,00:00:46.480,00:00:48.950
syndrome sharks that's just one of many,00:00:48.960,00:00:51.910
problems with outdoor furniture it falls,00:00:51.920,00:00:53.990
apart easily it's very uncomfortable or,00:00:54.000,00:00:56.470
they're stored in the garage somewhere,00:00:56.480,00:00:57.750
never to be used,00:00:57.760,00:00:59.189
at outer we've solved all of those,00:00:59.199,00:01:01.189
problems we've created the perfect,00:01:01.199,00:01:03.110
outdoor sofa that's as comfortable as,00:01:03.120,00:01:05.270
your bed and as durable as your camping,00:01:05.280,00:01:07.750
equipment all while using eco-friendly,00:01:07.760,00:01:10.070
materials,00:01:10.080,00:01:11.270
most importantly no more soggy bottoms,00:01:11.280,00:01:14.070
without patent-pending invention the,00:01:14.080,00:01:15.910
outer shell cover let me show you how it,00:01:15.920,00:01:17.429
works,00:01:17.439,00:01:18.469
in the evening all you have to do,00:01:18.479,00:01:20.710
is cover up and then pull the outer,00:01:20.720,00:01:23.109
shell over and the cushion is completely,00:01:23.119,00:01:25.190
protected from the elements,00:01:25.200,00:01:27.190
if you know there's a rainstorm coming,00:01:27.200,00:01:29.429
all you have to do is,00:01:29.439,00:01:31.190
take it and go with you so it's very,00:01:31.200,00:01:33.190
easy to carry and store cool,00:01:33.200,00:01:35.190
for the next morning there's going to be,00:01:35.200,00:01:36.789
a layer of morning dew on here but all,00:01:36.799,00:01:39.030
you have to do is,00:01:39.040,00:01:41.190
open it up flip it open,00:01:41.200,00:01:43.429
the perfect sofa ready for you to enjoy,00:01:43.439,00:01:46.950
so we've created the perfect outdoor,00:01:46.960,00:01:49.270
sofa but we realized that the shopping,00:01:49.280,00:01:51.270
experience wasn't great typically when,00:01:51.280,00:01:52.950
you see an outdoor sofa you see it,00:01:52.960,00:01:54.789
inside in a climate controlled,00:01:54.799,00:01:56.389
environment where it never has seen sun,00:01:56.399,00:01:59.030
rain or bird poop so we've actually,00:01:59.040,00:02:01.350
revolutionized the shopping experience,00:02:01.360,00:02:03.510
we've developed a proprietary,00:02:03.520,00:02:05.109
peer-to-peer showroom platform it's,00:02:05.119,00:02:07.030
where we convert our customers showrooms,00:02:07.040,00:02:09.270
into our showrooms and in doing so,00:02:09.280,00:02:11.830
customers can see touch and feel the,00:02:11.840,00:02:14.550
sofa before they decide to buy it's,00:02:14.560,00:02:16.550
something that we call the neighborhood,00:02:16.560,00:02:17.750
showroom it's the sharing economy,00:02:17.760,00:02:20.229
for retail so sharks who is ready to,00:02:20.239,00:02:22.390
join us to bring life outside,00:02:22.400,00:02:25.670
how much does the sofa cost so the sofa,00:02:25.680,00:02:28.150
you're looking at right now the,00:02:28.160,00:02:29.270
three-seater is 2500,00:02:29.280,00:02:31.589
okay,00:02:31.599,00:02:32.710
i don't think that's what does it cost,00:02:32.720,00:02:34.070
you land so so each share is 800 so,00:02:34.080,00:02:37.190
they're modular by the way i don't know,00:02:37.200,00:02:39.110
retail cost is eight eight twenty,00:02:39.120,00:02:40.710
dollars you can average it out and then,00:02:40.720,00:02:42.790
the cost of goods made is about two,00:02:42.800,00:02:44.150
twenty five or so two twenty five yeah,00:02:44.160,00:02:47.030
so i wanna make sure i understand this,00:02:47.040,00:02:48.790
is instead of having a showroom where,00:02:48.800,00:02:50.710
you have your own retail space so to,00:02:50.720,00:02:53.110
speak your customers are opening up,00:02:53.120,00:02:54.949
their backyards exactly you guys do i,00:02:54.959,00:02:56.630
understand that right you got that,00:02:56.640,00:02:57.589
perfectly so,00:02:57.599,00:02:58.869
what do i get paid for allowing that to,00:02:58.879,00:03:00.710
happen yeah so we're testing uh that,00:03:00.720,00:03:02.550
right now and uh you you're expected to,00:03:02.560,00:03:04.869
make about 20 to 50 dollars per visit,00:03:04.879,00:03:07.110
and the platform that we built when you,00:03:07.120,00:03:08.710
you have to book a visit you can't just,00:03:08.720,00:03:09.750
show up to somebody's home randomly,00:03:09.760,00:03:11.190
right thank you so much 750 000. four,00:03:11.200,00:03:14.309
percent puts 18,00:03:14.319,00:03:16.790
eight,00:03:16.800,00:03:17.589
18.7 million yes why is this worth 18,00:03:17.599,00:03:21.190
plus million dollars so kevin they're,00:03:21.200,00:03:23.190
they're so the outdoor furniture market,00:03:23.200,00:03:24.630
in the u.s nine billion dollars oh,00:03:24.640,00:03:26.789
that's the worst answer,00:03:26.799,00:03:29.589
it's a very bad thing to say kevin how,00:03:29.599,00:03:31.430
big is the bankruptcy market in the u.s,00:03:31.440,00:03:33.110
it's really really big well go ahead,00:03:33.120,00:03:34.470
jake uh we we just launched about four,00:03:34.480,00:03:37.110
months ago and we did about eight,00:03:37.120,00:03:39.270
hundred thousand dollars in sales to,00:03:39.280,00:03:40.949
date you haven't made any money yet have,00:03:40.959,00:03:42.710
you uh we're not making money yet why 18,00:03:42.720,00:03:45.110
million what's the reason yeah um so we,00:03:45.120,00:03:48.550
first of all we just closed our last,00:03:48.560,00:03:49.830
round uh with our vc backed at what,00:03:49.840,00:03:51.910
valuation that was 13.5 million,00:03:51.920,00:03:53.670
valuation so you came into the shark,00:03:53.680,00:03:55.270
tank and raised it even more how much do,00:03:55.280,00:03:57.270
you project this year this year we're,00:03:57.280,00:03:59.110
going to close out at least a million,00:03:59.120,00:04:00.710
dollars next year we're projecting five,00:04:00.720,00:04:02.470
so how many partners do you have and,00:04:02.480,00:04:04.869
what percentage of the company do you,00:04:04.879,00:04:06.390
two own i own sixty percent carry on 25,00:04:06.400,00:04:10.070
and my family factory owns 15 so another,00:04:10.080,00:04:13.190
another answer to the valuation is,00:04:13.200,00:04:14.869
because we've actually taken out the,00:04:14.879,00:04:17.030
risk on the supply chain so they,00:04:17.040,00:04:18.469
essentially giving us that cost right,00:04:18.479,00:04:20.229
your family's subsidizing you by not,00:04:20.239,00:04:22.069
taking a margin because they own 15,00:04:22.079,00:04:24.629
percent of the business that's,00:04:24.639,00:04:26.830
right have to pay for the inventory,00:04:26.840,00:04:28.070
until we sell it that's interesting,00:04:28.080,00:04:30.469
so guys uh,00:04:30.479,00:04:32.870
you know the valuation is crazy you know,00:04:32.880,00:04:35.189
you're gonna,00:04:35.199,00:04:36.150
you only sold 800 000 hopefully 1.5 and,00:04:36.160,00:04:39.189
you're you're evaluating it over 18,00:04:39.199,00:04:41.670
million dollars you know exactly what's,00:04:41.680,00:04:43.510
going to happen to you here right so i'm,00:04:43.520,00:04:46.390
out so so for me coming from silicon,00:04:46.400,00:04:49.110
valley i'm used to seeing mass,00:04:49.120,00:04:50.950
evaluations all the time and and i i,00:04:50.960,00:04:53.510
frankly i way overpaid for a number of,00:04:53.520,00:04:55.430
deals that i think can potentially,00:04:55.440,00:04:56.950
change the world or actually have a huge,00:04:56.960,00:04:58.710
impact i don't think it's it's,00:04:58.720,00:05:00.150
world-changing for me so for that reason,00:05:00.160,00:05:03.029
i'm out,00:05:03.039,00:05:05.590
hey guys i think it's a great business,00:05:05.600,00:05:08.070
could it be 100 million dollar business,00:05:08.080,00:05:09.590
yeah it really could be but look at it,00:05:09.600,00:05:11.510
from my end right let's just say you do,00:05:11.520,00:05:13.749
200 million dollars sure and your,00:05:13.759,00:05:15.749
margins are 10 net margins you'd be,00:05:15.759,00:05:18.390
thrilled to death you're making 20,00:05:18.400,00:05:19.990
million dollars i'm making 5 of that,00:05:20.000,00:05:23.029
that's i mean that's not bad money but,00:05:23.039,00:05:25.350
the risk reward for versus what you're,00:05:25.360,00:05:27.350
asking just is not there well the,00:05:27.360,00:05:29.510
current d2c brands have a multiple of,00:05:29.520,00:05:31.670
anywhere from three yeah but that's,00:05:31.680,00:05:33.029
great you and you found the vcs that pay,00:05:33.039,00:05:35.189
those kind of multiples right that ain't,00:05:35.199,00:05:37.189
me that's not shark tank for those,00:05:37.199,00:05:38.950
